I am an expert web developer with over 20 years experience - I've been building websites since the web itself was new.

With a background both in-house and in agencies, I've worked on hundreds of web projects large and small, simple and complex. I understand not just how the web works, but how best to use it to solve problems.

I take pride in my craft: I care deeply about clean code, about accessibility, and about user-centered iterative design.
